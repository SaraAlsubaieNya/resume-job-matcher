Objective
To obtain a role where I can continue teaching machines to think better than I do, pretend I understand deep math, and explain complex models using kitchen metaphors. Looking for a data/AI team that appreciates random forest jokes and accepts that sometimes the data just doesn’t want to cooperate.

Education
Bachelor of Science in Data Guessing (aka Data Science)
University of Mostly Correct Predictions
Graduated: Eventually
